# Whetting Your Appetite üçî

If you use computers frequently, you might come across a task that you would like to automate. For instance, you might want to execute a search-and-replace on several text files, or rename and organize a group of photo files in a complex way. Perhaps you want to create a custom database, a specialized GUI application, or a simple game.

If you are a professional software developer, you might work with several C/C++/Java libraries but find the write/compile/test/re-compile cycle too slow. Maybe you are composing a test suite for a library and find writing the testing code to be a tedious job. Or maybe you have developed a program that would benefit from an extension language, and you don't want to create a whole new language for your application.

Python is the perfect language for you.

You could write Unix shell scripts or Windows batch files for some of these tasks, but shell scripts are ideal for moving around files and changing text data, not suited for GUI applications or games. You could write a C/C++/Java program, but it can take a lot of development time to get even a first-draft program. Python is simpler to use, available on Windows, macOS, and Unix operating systems, and will help you get the job done more quickly.

Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, offering much more structure and support for large programs than shell scripts or batch files can offer. On the other hand, Python also offers much more error checking than C, and, being a very-high-level language, it has high-level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries.

Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs. It comes with a large collection of standard modules that you can use as the basis of your programs ‚Äî or as examples to start learning to program in Python.

Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary. The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it easy to experiment with features of the language, to write throw-away programs, or to test functions during bottom-up program development. It is also a handy desk calculator.

Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:

- the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;
- statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;
- no variable or argument declarations are necessary.

Python is extensible: if you know how to program in C it is easy to add a new built-in function or module to the interpreter, either to perform critical operations at maximum speed, or to link Python programs to libraries that may only be available in binary form.

By the way, the language is named after the BBC show ‚ÄúMonty Python‚Äôs Flying Circus‚Äù and has nothing to do with reptiles. Making references to Monty Python skits in documentation is not only allowed, it is encouraged!

Now that you are all excited about Python, you‚Äôll want to examine it in some more detail. Since the best way to learn a language is to use it, the tutorial invites you to play with the Python interpreter as you read.

In the next chapter, the mechanics of using the interpreter are explained. This is rather mundane information, but essential for trying out the examples shown later.

The rest of the tutorial introduces various features of the Python language and system through examples, beginning with simple expressions, statements and data types, through functions and modules, and finally touching upon advanced concepts like exceptions and user-defined classes.
