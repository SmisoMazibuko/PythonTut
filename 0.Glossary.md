## Python Glossary 📖🐍

Here are some important terms from the Python glossary:

### Prompt 💻

The `>>>` symbol is the default Python prompt in the interactive shell when entering Python code. It is often seen in code examples that can be executed interactively in the interpreter. It is also used when entering the code for an indented code block, within a pair of matching left and right delimiters (parentheses, square brackets, curly braces or triple quotes), or after specifying a decorator.

### Ellipsis ⋯

The `Ellipsis` is a built-in constant in Python that can be used to represent a slice of a sequence. It is often used in conjunction with NumPy arrays to represent a slice of an array that is not contiguous.
In real-world scenarios, you might encounter a large dataset where you need to perform calculations on only a small portion of the data. To save memory and processing time, you can use the Ellipsis to represent a slice of the data that you want to work with, rather than copying the entire dataset into memory. This is a common problem in data analysis and machine learning, where datasets can be very large and memory-intensive.

Using the Ellipsis in conjunction with NumPy arrays requires problem-solving skills, as you need to determine the appropriate slice of data to work with and apply the relevant calculations. This type of problem-solving is a fundamental skill required in programming, and is essential for building effective and efficient algorithms that can handle real-world scenarios.
### 2to3 🔧

`2to3` is a tool that attempts to convert Python 2.x code to Python 3.x code by handling most of the incompatibilities that can be detected by parsing the source and traversing the parse tree. It is available in the standard library as lib2to3, and a standalone entry point is provided as Tools/scripts/2to3. The tool can be used to automate the process of converting Python 2 code to Python 3, which can be helpful when upgrading older codebases to the latest version of the language.

### Abstract Base Class (ABC) 🦆👩‍💻

An Abstract Base Class (ABC) is a way to define interfaces in Python by creating virtual subclasses that don't inherit from a class, but are still recognized by `isinstance()` and `issubclass()`. ABCs complement duck-typing by providing a way to define interfaces when other techniques like `hasattr()` would be clumsy or wrong, for example, with magic methods.

🌍 In real-world scenarios, ABCs are commonly used in large codebases to define interfaces between modules and ensure that functions and classes meet certain requirements. This requires strong problem-solving skills, as you need to design effective and efficient interfaces that can handle a variety of use cases.

### Annotation 📝💻

An `annotation` is a label associated with a variable, class attribute, or function parameter or return value, used as a type hint by convention. Annotations of global variables, class attributes, and functions are stored in the `__annotations__` special attribute of modules, classes, and functions, respectively. 

🌍 In real-world scenarios, annotations are commonly used in large codebases to ensure that variables and functions are used correctly and to help identify bugs and errors early in the development process. This requires strong programming skills, as you need to design effective and efficient annotations that can handle a variety of use cases.

Annotations of local variables cannot be accessed at runtime, which means that annotations are mainly useful as a tool for developers to help them write better code. However, global annotations can be accessed at runtime and can be used to implement dynamic type checking or other runtime checks.


### Argument 📜👩‍💻

An `argument` is a value passed to a function (or method) when calling the function. There are two kinds of arguments in Python: keyword arguments and positional arguments.

🌍 In real-world scenarios, understanding how to use arguments effectively is essential for building functions that can solve complex problems. For example, when working with large datasets, you might need to pass multiple arguments to a function to filter or aggregate the data. This requires strong problem-solving skills, as you need to design functions that can handle a variety of use cases and are optimized for performance.

Arguments are assigned to the named local variables in a function body. Any expression can be used to represent an argument, and the evaluated value is assigned to the local variable. Understanding how to manipulate and work with arguments is an essential skill for programming in Python.
